University is bad at teaching staff to *teach* effectively, so I've decided to do a series of blog posts on my experiences! What worked, what didn't, and why certain things worked.
This post is the first in the series and covers **Cognitive Load Theory**. Find all the posts below:

## What is Cognitive Load Theory?

Cognitive Load Theory is an empirical theory which underpins, or at least relates to, most modern teaching methodologies. It's focussed on understanding how the way humans think enables and limits how we learn. At it's core, it focusses on two things:

1. How many concepts/information/input can someone keep track of at once?
2. What factors affect this?

## What is Cognitive Load?

Learning is a change in students' long-term memory. When teaching, we want to help students not just grasp new concepts briefly, in isolation, but bed them down as in long-term memory.

New ideas don't come free however. When learning a novel concept, working memory is consumed. This is known as *intrinsic cognitive load*, because the working memory is intrinsically or inherently needed to learn the new concept.

Most people have enough working memory for 7(Â±2) concepts, so the magic number is 5-9 concepts. So, this means that you can introduce 5 concepts safely every lesson, right?

Not Quite.

Not all concepts and ideas are created equally. When it comes to introducing new ideas, it's important to be gauging how much cognitive loading is required to both engage with and learn the new concepts. Harder concepts *will* have a higher cognitive load, as will more novel concepts.

### But wait, you keep calling this *intrinsic*. We can make external cognitive loads?

Yep. Bad powerpoints are secretly notorious examples of this.

Where *intrinsic* loads come from the difficulty of the concepts, *extrinsic* cognitive loadings instead are the loadings from *how* the new concepts or information are being presented to the student. In short, how hard is it to *get to* the information.

## How can I use this?

### Extrinsically?

It's also important to note that all of these loadings, and how they

### Intrinsically?

While extrinsic loads seem most obvious, it's also important to be aware of managing intrinsic cognitive loads.
Intrinsic loads can be managed by planning not just to deliver the content, but also planning *who* around the audience is. Teaching to a classroom of university students, for instance, will often be able to go at a faster pace than high school students. Some empirically supported teaching strategies also allow for proactive management of intrinsic cognitive loads at a more nuanced level.

#### Sign-Posting

A very basic method for managing cognitive loading is simple: avoid surprises, and tell students what you want them to learn.
While this sounds immediately simple, it's a very powerful method because it prepares students to engage with the concept, and done well also tells them what you're looking for them to take away from the lesson.

Ways to do this include spending a few minutes at the start of the lesson.

#### Scaffolding

Scaffolding is a more planned method for managing cognitive loading, but one with very high effectiveness. It consists of breaking up a lesson into distinct parts or levels which build upon each other, gradually increasing in both the task difficulty and autonomy provided to students.

A basic example of this might be working through a new maths example on the board, then getting students to work through minimal or assisted examples, before assigning a homework set of more challenging examples. In this way, students are able to gradually develop their skills, reducing the intrinsic cognitive loading at any single point in time. Growing autonomy in this way can also improve engagement, as students are empowered to take ownership of their learning.

At larger scales, scaffolding is present in almost all educational syllabuses. It's why we learn basic algebra and linear equations before attempting polynomials and calculus.

In more contextual scenarios, it's also possible to provide a scaffolding by relating to situations or concepts a student is already familiar with, such as comparing projectile motion or parabolas to a ball. By linking to a well-established concept for the student, it's possible to avoid the higher intrinsic cognitive load common to introducing unfamiliar concepts.

A challenge with scaffolding is picking the pacing correctly. Too fast and you risk losing students attention as they become overwhelmed from a high *intrinsic* cognitive loading, or too slow and they disengage due to boredom. Judging student's comfort and engagement is a skill that takes time, practise and experience to develop.

#### Narrative Based Teaching -- TODO: Make this it's own post?

Narrative based teaching is a powerful tool to manage intrinsic cognitive loads, because it appeals to a very basic form of human communication: Storytelling.
Teaching with a narrative is not coming up with a grand fantasy adventure of how a knight used calculus to slay a dragon, however. It's just about using the *core structures* of narratives: the Introduction, a Complication, and Resolution.
Or, in other words: What is being taught, why/how is it being taught, and finally how the new concept can help the students.

## *Further Reading*

Thanks for reading! Human psychology is a complex and nuanced field, so this post is unlikely to have done the field proper justice. I hope it is of use for It also falls well below the standards for a proper psychology paper, as it has a severe lacks of the proper references you should expect in a work on the subject.
