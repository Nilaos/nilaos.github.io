University is bad at teaching staff to *teach* effectively, so I've decided to do a series of blog posts on my experiences! What worked, what didn't, and why certain things worked.
This post is the first in the series and covers **Cognitive Load Theory**. Find all the posts below:

## What is Cognitive Load Theory?

Cognitive Load Theory is an empirical theory which underpins, or at least relates to, most modern teaching methodologies. It's focussed on understanding how the way humans think enables and limits how we learn. At it's core, it focusses on two things:

1. How many concepts/information/input can someone keep track of at once?
2. What factors affect this?

## What is Cognitive Load?

Learning is a change in students' long-term memory. When teaching, we want to help students not just grasp new concepts briefly, in isolation, but bed them down as in long-term memory.

New ideas don't come free however. When learning a novel concept, working memory is consumed. This is known as *intrinsic cognitive load*, because the working memory is intrinsically or inherently needed to learn the new concept.

Most people have enough working memory for 7(Â±2) concepts, so the magic number is 5-9 concepts. So, this means that you can introduce 5 concepts safely every lesson, right?

Not Quite.

Not all concepts and ideas are created equally. When it comes to introducing new ideas, it's important to be gauging how much cognitive loading is required to both engage with and learn the new concepts. Harder concepts *will* have a higher cognitive load, as will more novel concepts.

### But wait, you keep calling this *intrinsic*. We can make external cognitive loads?

Yep. Bad powerpoints are secretly notorious examples of this.

Where *intrinsic* loads come from the difficulty of the concepts, *extrinsic* cognitive loadings instead are the loadings from *how* the new concepts or information are being presented to the student. In short, how hard is it to *get to* the information.

## How can I use this?

### Extrinsically?

It's also important to note that all of these loadings, and how they

### Intrinsically?

While extrinsic loads seem most obvious, it's also important to be aware of managing intrinsic cognitive loads.
Intrinsic loads can be managed by planning not just to deliver the content, but also planning *who* around the audience is. Teaching to a classroom of university students, for instance, will often be able to go at a faster pace than high school students. Some empirically supported teaching strategies also allow for proactive management of intrinsic cognitive loads at a more nuanced level.

#### Sign-Posting

A very basic method for managing cognitive loading is simple: **avoid surprises**, and tell students **what** you want them to learn, and **why**.
While this sounds immediately simple, it's a very powerful method because it prepares students to engage with the concept, and done well also tells them what you're looking for them to take away from the lesson.

Ways to do this include spending a few minutes at the start of the lesson discussing what you're planning on covering in the lesson, and how those link to course outcomes, syllabus points, or upcoming assessments. It sounds simple, and it is, so just take care to avoid extrinsic loads such as long, rambling explanations. Short and punchy introductions are the best!

The trick to doing sign-posting effectively is to also link back to it throughout the lesson. As you move into new activities, spend thirty seconds explaining how the activity also links back to your stated learning aims for the lesson. While this has benefits for reducing intrinsic loading, it's also been shown to improve engagement - a win-win!

#### Scaffolding

Scaffolding is a more planned method for managing cognitive loading, but one with very high effectiveness. It consists of breaking up a lesson into distinct parts or levels which build upon each other, gradually increasing in both the task difficulty and autonomy provided to students.

A basic example of this might be working through a new maths example on the board, then getting students to work through minimal or assisted examples, before assigning a homework set of more challenging examples. In this way, students are able to gradually develop their skills, reducing the intrinsic cognitive loading at any single point in time. Growing autonomy in this way can also improve engagement, as students are empowered to take ownership of their learning.

At larger scales, scaffolding is present in almost all educational syllabuses. It's why we learn basic algebra and linear equations before attempting polynomials and calculus.

In more contextual scenarios, it's also possible to provide a scaffolding by relating to situations or concepts a student is already familiar with, such as comparing projectile motion or parabolas to a ball. By linking to a well-established concept for the student, it's possible to avoid the higher intrinsic cognitive load common to introducing unfamiliar concepts.

A challenge with scaffolding is picking the pacing correctly. Too fast and you risk losing students attention as they become overwhelmed from a high *intrinsic* cognitive loading, or too slow and they disengage due to boredom. Judging student's comfort and engagement is a skill that takes time, practise and experience to develop.

#### Content Pacing: Don't overload a single lesson

A third valuable tool to manage intrinsic cognitive loads appears simple on the surface. Avoiding overloading students with content sounds obvious, because intuitively they need time to actually learn things (cue oft-receited adages of "can't build Rome in a day"). The key point here is that there is very solid evidence behind attention to the pacing of content being important.

The key symptom of too-fast pacing is disengagement. This occurs as students' overloaded working memory struggles to keep up with the content, and eventually the student 'gives up' on trying to keep up with content. Preemptively, however, teachers can also judge the total content they plan to cover and discuss it with more experienced colleagues. There's also some tools which can be used in the classroom too though!

One of the best ways to keep pacing appropriate for a class is to make the discourse two-way, by asking students questions and answering their questions. This provides a mechanism to find where you've gone too fast on some content, and the enforced pause of handling questions provides students with time to both bed-down concepts and to revise them before you move on to linking to the next topic.

There are also ramifications of going too slow in content. A poorly-recognised fact is that accelerated classes for 'gifted' students are simply another form of special-needs educational support, as boredom and disengagement will hurt the development of learners. At a smaller, more practical level, it is important to keep the broad class' pacing somewhere appropriate for the middle of the class. Students who are slightly behind can be then given more support when you have flexible time to do so, such as during exercises.

A key aspect to remember is that the effective pacing will vary heavily with different classes, so it can be effective to have a 'priority list' of key content to help focus lesson planning. Managing pacing can be difficult, and most of the signs of too-fast pacing will eventually be learnt from experience.

## *Further Reading*

Thanks for reading! Human psychology is a complex and nuanced field, so this post is unlikely to have done the field proper justice. I hope it is of use for It also falls well below the standards for a proper psychology paper, as it has a severe lacks of the proper references you should expect in a work on the subject. If you're interested in further light reading however, here's a few I can recommend:
