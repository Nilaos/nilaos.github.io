A commonly quoted term in CPU capabilities is the number of cores or threads available. This initially makes sense to provide, because in the world of multiprocessing and multithreading, it (mostly) governs how many tasks can be run truely parallel (TODO: Insert reference to CUDA blog).

These numbers often appear to have multiple values, however.
